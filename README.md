## Features

-   Anonymization of Faces: Utilize facial detection and blurring techniques to anonymize faces detected within images.
-   License Plate Anonymization: Apply object detection algorithms to identify and anonymize license plates present in images.
-   Customization Options: Configure parameters for anonymization, including blur intensity, detection thresholds, and output formats.
-   Compatibility: Compatible with common image formats such as JPEG, PNG, JPG and BMP.

## Requirements

-   Python 3.x
-   Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
-   OpenCV library for image processing
-   Face detection and recognition libraries YOLO
-   License plate recognition libraries YOLO model

## Installation

1.  Clone the repository to your local machine:

       git clone https://github.com/rakiiibul/LF_Anonymization.git
    
3.  Launch Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab and open the anonymization notebook file (`anonymization.ipynb`).

## Example

1.  Original images


 <img src="img/img1.jpg" alt="example1" width="600" height="450"/></a> 
  <img src="img/img2.jpg" alt="example2" width="600" height="450"/></a>
 

2.  Anonymized Images

    <img src="img/img1_ano.jpg" alt="example1" width="600" height="450"/></a>
    <img src="img/img2_ano.jpg" alt="example2" width="600" height="450"/></a>


## Usage

1.  Load your image dataset into the notebook environment.
2.  Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to execute the anonymization tools for faces and license plates.
3.  Adjust parameters and thresholds as needed to optimize the anonymization process.
4.  Review the anonymized images and ensure that sensitive information is adequately obscured.
5.  Export the anonymized dataset for further analysis or distribution.
